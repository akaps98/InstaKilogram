Github repo: https://github.com/akaps98/InstaKilogram

If you want to start and run our website you must have a cmd that have php support:
You can download php with the link here: https://www.php.net/downloads
after you download the link and the zip file contain the file name InstaKilogram
you will go directly to the folder 'www' that has index.php file. 
REMEMBER when you turn on the cmd to local host make sure you extract the zip file the same drive with your cmd
For example I download the my file in this drive: F:\InstaKilogram\www but my cmd is in drive C
I need to change the cmd to drive F by using 'F:' command to change drive 
after that you can use 'cd' and local host your webpage to see our project.
Below are the admin and user account u can use for testing our webpage.
